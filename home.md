# Introduction

Coding Box is a programming learning toolbox based on Arduino, which is a programming tool specially designed for children over 6 years old.

It integrates some of the most basic electronic components and sensors, such as LEDs, buttons, motors, light, sound, infrared and a temperature sensor.

Besides, multitudes of interesting projects can be carried out via the Coding Box, including LED flashing, intrusion alarms, smart fans as well as temperature testers.

|      LED             |     ![](media/ec7e1a38794a9a56d78e7ade6e58268c.png)  | D7 and D8  | LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (LEDS) have a positive<br> (+) leg and a negative (-) leg, which<br> make electricity flow through in one<br> direction.  LEDs can also burn out if too much<br> electricity flows through them, so you should use <br>a resistor to limit the high current when you<br> wire an LED into a circuit.  They can be <br>used to make equipment indicator light. Set the<br> signal pin to HIGH, LED will be on; set to<br> LOW, LED will be off.               |
